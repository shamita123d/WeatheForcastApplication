# WEATHER FORCAST APPLICATION
A Weather Forecast Application is a web-based platform that provides users with real-time weather information for any City. By integrating with external weather APIs, such as OpenWeatherMap, the app fetches and displays current conditions, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a brief description of the weather. Users can easily search for weather updates in different cities and stay informed about climate conditions. With a simple, user-friendly interface, the app serves as a reliable tool for planning daily activities based on up-to-date weather forecasts
